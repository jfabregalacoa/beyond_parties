**Summary**:  

Core question and context. The chapter asks whether Chile’s 2021–2022 Chilean Constitutional Convention—a body unusually dominated by independents (about two-thirds of 155 delegates)—produced better ideological representation of citizens than a more party-centered arrangement would have. It frames this as a problem of ideological congruence (citizen–representative alignment), long linked to democratic legitimacy.

Data and measurement strategy. Because citizen and candidate data came from two separate surveys, the author builds a common ideological scale by matching a subset of comparable questions across surveys: Indigenous recognition (plurinational vs national state), executive–legislative design (presidential vs semi-presidential), presidential term length, unicameral vs bicameral legislature, and subsidiary vs welfare state. Citizen data come from a survey fielded by Asociación de Investigadores de Mercado (N=2,873) shortly before the election; candidate responses were published by La Tercera and scraped by the author (932 candidates). A Bayesian latent-trait approach (following Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers-style scaling) is then used to place citizens and candidates on the same ideological dimension, followed by multiple robustness checks (correlations, logistic regression, distribution tests, and a random-forest classifier).

Main empirical findings: citizens are more moderate; candidates/elected are more polarized. The estimated ideological distributions are bimodal, but citizens appear more moderate than both the full candidate pool and elected delegates—especially on the left side. Formal distributional tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov) indicate statistically significant differences between citizens and candidates, and between citizens and elected members, while candidates and elected members do not differ significantly from each other. In short: the election did not “select” a more moderate subset of candidates; it largely reproduced the candidates’ polarized profile in the elected convention.

Testing the “voluntary voting / engaged voter” hypothesis. Because the election occurred during the pandemic and under voluntary voting, the chapter examines whether politically engaged citizens (measured using reported participation in voting, protests, and local deliberative events) might better match the convention’s ideology. The answer is no: both civically active and passive citizen subgroups still differ from elected delegates, and (notably) the civically active subgroup can look even more misaligned.

Simulation to identify a “matching” citizen subset. The author then runs repeated matching simulations to construct a citizen subsample whose ideological distribution mirrors that of elected delegates (matching citizens to delegates by ideological proximity). Comparing this matched group to the residual citizenry yields few systematic differences: most sociodemographics and participation indicators do not differ meaningfully; the clearest difference is age (the matched group is relatively younger), and one participation difference appears in a right-leaning subsample (town-hall participation). Overall, the chapter finds no evidence that the matched group is consistently more politically engaged in a way that would explain congruence via turnout or civic activism. 

Interpretation and implications. The chapter concludes that lowering barriers for independents did not improve ideological representation. A more plausible account is informational and affective: amid widespread party rejection and an overcrowded field of independent lists with limited voter information, citizens may have voted against parties rather than for well-understood ideological alternatives—producing delegates whose positions diverged from the broader public’s. For institutional design, the author argues that expanding access for independents should be paired with stronger transparency and voter-information mechanisms, and that party cues—despite low trust—can still structure ideological accountability.
